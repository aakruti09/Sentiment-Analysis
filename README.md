# Sentiment-Analysis
The IMDB large movie review dataset has many positive and negative reviews on movies. Download the dataset here (http://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/). Check the README file as it provides a
description of the dataset. Use the provided training and testing data for your network. You would need to go through data preprocessing to prepare the data for NLP. Then, create a network to classify the review as
positive or negative.
All choices are up to you and many resources exist online to help you make good design choices.
